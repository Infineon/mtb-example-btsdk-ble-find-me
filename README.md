## Using the Code Example

Refer to the `README` file in the root of the repo for instruction on how to build and program the code example using ModusToolBox IDE and CLI.

## Operation
1. Connect the kit to your PC using the provided USB cable.

   The USB Serial interface on the kit provides access to the two UART interfaces of the CYW20819 device – WICED HCI UART and WICED Peripheral UART (PUART). The HCI UART is used only for downloading the application code in this code example; PUART is for printing the Bluetooth stack and application trace messages.
2. Use your favorite serial terminal application and connect to the PUART serial port. Configure the terminal application to access the serial port using the following settings.
   Baud rate : 115200 bps; Data: 8 bits; Parity : None; Stop : 1 bit; Flow control : None; New line for receive data : Line Feed(LF) or Auto setting

3. Import the code example into a new or existing workspace. See [Importing Code Example into ModusToolbox IDE - KBA225201](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-15968) for details.

4.	Build and program the application: In the project explorer, select the project. The Quick Panel will get populated with various options. Scroll to the **Launches** section, and click the **Program configuration** link as shown in [Figure 1]().

##### Figure 1 Quick Panel with Program Configuration
![Figure1](./Images/figure1.PNG)

  **Note:** If the download fails, it is possible that a previously loaded application is preventing programming. For example, the application may use a custom baud rate that the download process does not detect, or the device may be in a low-power mode. In that case, it may be necessary to put the board in recovery mode, and then try the programming operation again from the IDE.
<br/>
  To enter recovery mode, first, press and hold the Recover button (SW1), then press the Reset button (SW2), release the Reset button (SW2), and then release the Recover button (SW1).

5.	Observe the yellow LED (LED1) starts blinking after the device starts advertising.

6.	To test using the CySmart mobile app, do the following (see equivalent CySmart app screenshots in [Figure 2](#figure-2-testing-with-the-cysmart-app-on-ios) and [Figure 3](#figure-3-testing-with-the-cysmart-app-on-android)):
<br/>
    1. Turn ON Bluetooth on your Android or iOS device.

    2. Launch the CySmart app.
<br/>
    3. Press the reset switch on the CYW920819EVB-02 kit to start sending advertisements. The yellow LED (LED1) starts blinking to indicate that advertising has started. Advertising will stop after 90 seconds if a connection has not been established.

    4. Swipe down on the CySmart app home screen to start scanning for BLE Peripherals; your device (“Find Me Target”) appears in the CySmart app home screen. Select your device to establish a BLE connection. Once the connection is established, the yellow LED (LED1) changes from blinking state to always ON state.
<br/>
    5. Select the 'Find Me' Profile from the carousel view.
<br/>
    6. Select an Alert Level value on the Find Me Profile screen. Observe the state of the red LED (LED2) on the device changes based on the alert level.

[Figure 2](#figure-2-testing-with-the-cysmart-app-on-ios) and [Figure 3](#figure-3-testing-with-the-cysmart-app-on-android) show the steps for using CySmart App on iOS and Android respectively.

##### Figure 2. Testing with the CySmart App on iOS
![Figure2](./Images/figure2.PNG)

##### Figure 3. Testing with the CySmart App on Android
![Figure3](./Images/figure3.PNG)

7.	Use the PUART serial port to view the Bluetooth stack and application trace messages in the terminal window as shown in [Figure 4]().

##### Figure 4. Log Messages on WICED PUART COM Port
![Figure4](./Images/figure4.PNG)

## Design and Implementation
The ‘Find Me Locator’ (the BLE Central device) is a BLE GATT Client. The ‘Find Me Target’ (the Peripheral device) is a BLE GATT Server with the IAS implemented, as [Figure 5]() shows.

##### Figure 5. Find Me profile (FMP) Implementation on CYW20819
![Figure5](./Images/figure5.PNG)

The BLE Find Me profile defines what happens when the locating Central device broadcasts a change in the alert level.

The Find Me locator performs service discovery using the "GATT Discover All Primary Services" procedure. The BLE Service Characteristic discovery is done by the "Discover All Characteristics of a Service" procedure. When the Find Me Locator wants to cause an alert on the Find Me Target, it writes an alert level in the Alert Level Characteristic of the IAS. When the Find Me Target receives an alert level, it indicates the level using the red LED: OFF for no alert, blinking for mild alert, and ON for high alert.

The application code and Bluetooth stack runs on the Arm® Cortex®-M4 core of the CYW20819 SoC. The important source files relevant for the user application level code for this code example are listed in [Table 1]().

##### Table 1. Important User-Application-Related Source Files

|**File Name**|**Comments**|
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|*main.c* | Contains the `application_start()` function, which is the entry point for execution of the user application code after device startup.|
|*app_bt_cfg.c, app_bt_cfg.h* |	These files contain the runtime Bluetooth stack configuration parameters such as device name and  advertisement/ connection settings. Note that the name that the device uses for advertising (“Find Me Target”) is defined in *app_bt_cfg.c*.|
|*app_bt_event_handler.c, app_bt_event_handler.h*|These files contain the code for the Bluetooth stack event handler functions. |
|app_user_interface.c, app_user_interface.h*	|These files contain the code for the application user interface (in this case, the LED) functionality.|
|*cycfg_gatt_db.c, cycfg_gatt_db.h*|	These files reside in the *GeneratedSource* folder under the application folder. They contain the GATT database information generated using the Bluetooth Configurator tool.|

See [AN225684 – Getting Started with CYW208xx](http://www.cypress.com/an225684) application note to understand the firmware design for this code example.

## Resources and Settings
This section explains the ModusToolbox resources and their configuration as used in this code example. Note that all the configuration explained in this section has already been done in the code example. The ModusToolbox IDE stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the graphical configurators, which generate the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

- **Device Configurator:** The Device Configurator is used to enable/configure the peripherals and the pins used in the application. For detailed information on how to use it, see
[Device Configurator Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth Configurator:** The Bluetooth Configurator is used for generating/modifying the BLE GATT database. For detailed information on how to use it, see
[Bluetooth Configurator Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).

## Common application settings

Application settings below are common for all BTSDK applications and can be configured via the makefile of the application or passed in via the command line.

**BT\_DEVICE\_ADDRESS**
> Set the BDA (Bluetooth Device Address) for your device. The address is 6 bytes, for example, 20819A10FFEE. By default, the SDK will set a BDA for your device by combining the 7 hex digit device ID with the last 5 hex digits of the host PC MAC address.

**UART**
> Set to the UART port you want to use to download the application. For example 'COM6' on Windows or '/dev/ttyWICED\_HCI\_UART0' on Linux or '/dev/tty.usbserial-000154' on macOS. By default, the SDK will auto-detect the port.

**ENABLE_DEBUG**
> For HW debugging, configure ENABLE\_DEBUG=1. See the document [WICED-Hardware-Debugging](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/btsdk-docs/blob/master/docs/BT-SDK/WICED-Hardware-Debugging.pdf) for more information. This setting configures GPIO for SWD.<br>

## Tracing
To view application traces, there are 2 methods available. Note that the
application needs to configure the tracing options.<br>

1. WICED Peripheral UART - Open this port on your computer using a serial port
utility such as Tera Term or PuTTY (usually using 115200 baud rate for non-Mesh apps, and 921600 for Mesh apps).<br>
2. WICED HCI UART - Open this port on your computer using the Client Control
application mentioned above (usually using 3M baud rate). Then run the BT Spy
utility mentioned above.

## Using BSPs (platforms)

BTSDK BSPs are located in the \mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ folder by default.

#### a. Selecting an alternative BSP

The application makefile has a default BSP. See "TARGET". The makefile also has a list of other BSPs supported by the application. See "SUPPORTED_TARGETS". To select an alternative BSP, use Library Manager from the Quick Panel to deselect the current BSP and select an alternate BSP. Then right-click the newly selected BSP and choose 'Set Active'.  This will automatically update TARGET in the application makefile.

#### b. Custom BSP

**Complete BSP**

To create and use a complete custom BSP that you want to use in applications, perform the following steps:

1. Select an existing BSP created through ModusToolbox Project Creator that you wish to use as a template.
2. Make a copy in the same folder and rename it. For example mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_mybsp.<br/>
   **Note:** This can be done in the system File Explorer and then refresh the workspace in ModusToolbox to see the new project.  Delete the .git sub-folder from the newly copied folder before refreshing in Eclipse.
   If done in the IDE, an error dialog may appear complaining about items in the .git folder being out of sync.  This can be resolved by deleting the .git sub-folder in the newly copied folder.

3. In the new mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_mybsp\<branch>\ folder, rename the existing/original (BSP).mk file to mybsp.mk.
4. In the application makefile, set TARGET=mybsp and add it to SUPPORTED\_TARGETS.
5. In the application libs folder, edit the mtb.mk file and replace all instances of the template BSP name string with 'mybsp'.
6. Update design.modus for your custom BSP if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
7. Update the application makefile as needed for other custom BSP specific attributes and build the application.

**Custom Pin Configuration Only - Multiple Apps**

To create a custom pin configuration to be used by multiple applications using an existing BSP that supports Device Configurator, perform the following steps:

1. Create a folder COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus in the existing BSP folder. For example mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\TARGET\_CYW920819EVB-02\<branch>\COMPONENT\_my\_design\_modus
2. Copy the file design.modus from the reference BSP COMPONENT\_bsp\_design\_modus folder under mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ and place the file in the newly created COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus folder.
3. In the application makefile, add the following two lines<br/>
   DISABLE\_COMPONENTS+=bsp\_design\_modus<br/>
   COMPONENTS+=(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus<br/>
   (for example COMPONENTS+=my\_design\_modus)
4. Update design.modus for your custom pin configuration if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
5. Building of the application will generate pin configuration source code under a GeneratedSource folder in the new COMPONENT\_(CUSTOM)\_design\_modus folder.

**Custom Pin Configuration Only - Per App**

To create a custom configuration to be used by a single application from an existing BSP that supports Device Configurator, perform the following steps:

1. Create a folder COMPONENT\_(BSP)\_design\_modus in your application. For example COMPONENT\_CYW920721B2EVK-02\_design\_modus
2. Copy the file design.modus from the reference BSP under mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\bsp\ and place the file in this folder.
3. In the application makefile, add the following two lines<br/>
   DISABLE\_COMPONENTS+=bsp\_design\_modus<br/>
   COMPONENTS+=(BSP)\_design\_modus<br/>
   (for example COMPONENTS+=CYW920721B2EVK-02\_design\_modus)
4. Update design.modus for your custom pin configuration if needed using the **Device Configurator** link under **Configurators** in the Quick Panel.
5. Building of the application will generate pin configuration source code under the GeneratedSource folder in your application.


## Using libraries

The libraries needed by the app can be found in in the mtb\_shared\wiced\_btsdk\dev-kit\libraries folder. To add an additional library to your application, launch the Library Manager from the Quick Panel to add a library. Then update the makefile variable "COMPONENTS" of your application to include the library. For example:<br/>
   COMPONENTS += fw\_upgrade\_lib
